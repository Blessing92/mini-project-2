# Mini-project-2

## Requirements
- Python version 3.X (We used 3.9)
- sockets
- _thread

## How to run the program
Run ```python3 Generals_Byzantine_program.py <number of nodes>```

## Commands

- ```actual-order order```: give the order to attack or retreat
- ```g-state ID State```: define a new state for the node if id ID (if no parameters are passed, it lists the nodes and their states)
- ```g-kill ID Kill```: kill the node
- ```nodes``g-add n```: adds n new nodes
- ```exit```: exits the program

## 3N+1 problem
Note that we applied the 3N+1 rule to the program.
In the case of only 2 secondary nodes, our programm still applies the 3N+1 rule.

## Working method
We used the following working method:
- Percé worled on the programm in python
- Emmanuel worked on the programm in java
In the end, we choose the python version as it was complete and worked.
Emmanuel had a hard time in java working with the sockets, which is why we used the python version in the end, and the reason why Percé mostly commited in this repository.
